Lab20 subnetting

1. Which subnet does host 192.168.77.108/28 belong to?
	192.168.77.108 	11000000 10101000 01001101 01101100
	255.255.255.240	11111111 11111111 11111111 11110000
			-----------------------------------
	192.168.77.96	11000000 10101000 01001101 01100000


2. What valid host range is the IP address 172.21.71.219/20 a part of?
	172.21.64.1 - 172.21.79.254

3. What is the first valid host on the subnetwork that the node 172.16.139.35/26 belongs to?
	172.16.139.1 

4. What is the broadcast address of the network 172.30.134.0/23?
	172.30.135.255

5. How many subnets and hosts can you get from the network 172.20.0.0 if you want to partition it into subnets like 172.20.0.0/255.255.254.0?
	172.20.0.0    10101100 00010100 00000000 00000000
	255.255.254.0 00000000 01111111 11111111 11111111
		      -----------------------------------
	0.20.0.0      00000000 00010100 00000000 00000000
	2^(32-23) - 2 = 512 - 2
	= /23 which is 512 hosts, therefore 510 available hosts.
	

Sometimes you need to know the class of an address, for example, to answer a question such as this one. The class of an address, and therefore its network mask, can be determined by the first few bits of the address, as shown below.

6. Given the following address allocations, create two further allocations, a /29 (“Test Network”) and a /27 (“Sensor Network”), such that fragmentation of the address space is minimised. The “Test Network” can be a subnet of the Engineering subnet.
	172.16.20.1/27	Test Network
	172.16.20.32/29	Sensor Network
